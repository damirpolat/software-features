Call `extract.sh` script with arguments specified in the script. 
`soft` is the path to feature extractor (Metrix++)
`parser` is a script that parses the output of feature extractor (`parse.awk`)

Metrix++ is the feature extractor. Since I first extracted the features, 
the authors released newer versions of the software. 
Check out their [website](https://github.com/metrixplusplus/metrixplusplus/releases) for more 
recent versions of the software.
